                                <p class="justify">Periodontal disease, if left untreated, can eventually lead to tooth loss due to chronic inflammation in the periodontal space. During this process, gingival recession occurs, exposing the root of the tooth. Synthetic scaffolds may be used to create tissue engineered constructs to aid in the regeneration of the gingival tissues. An electrospun scaffold with an embedded antimicrobial polymer has been proposed for this purpose, and this study aims to characterize its cell compatibility properties. Cytocompatibility of the 7 day scaffold biodegradation and
antimicrobial release products was tested with human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) using a cell metabolic assay and DNA quantification. Results indicate that there is a reduction in the cell metabolic activity for cells exposed to the most concentrated solution of biodegradation and release products. Further investigation showed that the product responsible for the lowered metabolic activity is soluble and may be accumulating during the biodegradation study, as the cytotoxic effect was more pronounced for products taken from later time points of the study. However, the in vivo concentration of the release products is expected to be much lower due to constant circulation of fluids through the highly vascularized tissue. Results also indicate that the HGF cells are able to attach on the scaffolds and remain viable after 24 hours of culture. Overall, this study provides further insight on the cell compatibility of these scaffolds for their use as infection resistant tissue engineering scaffolds.</p>

                                <p class="justify">Spinal cord injuries cause a reduction in motor function, and regular limb functionality assessments are a crucial component of the rehabilitation process. Upper-limb functionality assessments are of particular interest, due to the high priority placed upon restoration of upper-limb function among tetraplegics. Currently, the
frequency of these assessments is limited by the need for patients to meet with a medical professional to measure their range-of-motion and evaluate their ability to perform a standard series of upper-limb movements. The ability to acquire data from more frequent functional assessments is desired in order to personalize patient treatment. The increasingly widespread use of smartphone and smartwatch technologies and recent advances in their motion-sensing capabilities makes these devices ideal for this purpose. An Android-based self-administered system for frequent upper-limb functional workspace measurements to track neurological recovery in a non-clinical setting has been developed. The core smartwatch application interfaces with three main software and hardware modules: the device sensor module for capturing sensor input, the signals processing engine for analyzing the sensor data, and the information display library for visualizing the results of the measurement. Preliminary tests have shown that this system can be used to measure upper-limb functional workspace, but requires averaging of several trials for accurate data. Further work would involve ne tuning the signals processing algorithms and volume models to enhance the accuracy of the system. This proof of concept system demonstrates the ability for physicians to track upper-limb functional workspace recovery using commonly available consumer electronics.</p>

                                <a href="assets/files/ANDREWWONG_foodallergentester.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="assets/thumbs/foodallergentester_thumb.png" width="40%"/></a>
                                <p class="justify">This document demonstrates the interest among people with food allergies for a food allergen intake tracking device, proposes the design of such a wearable health device, and outlines the regulatory strategy required to market the device as a medical product. Over 150 million people worldwide are estimated to have an allergy to one or more foods, with reactions ranging from rashes and hives to fatal anaphylaxis [1]. As a cure for food allergies does not exist, people with food allergies must avoid consuming food allergens in order to prevent a reaction from occurring [1]. One way to
avoid the consumption of food allergens is to detect the presence of food allergens in foods prior to consumption. Our design team wrote and distributed a survey to determine whether there was a market interested in such a food intake tracking device, and what their concerns and priorities were for a hypothetical wearable device. Additionally, from a survey of current products available to track the potential intake of food allergens, lateral flow immunochromatic assays were determined to be the
most suited for implementation in a wearable food intake tracking device. However, we found that current methods would be considered too cumbersome for the average person, and in order to achieve market penetration and product adherence, the design must be simplified and easy to use. Modifications to the standard assay for translation to a wearable device include decreasing the size of the device and integrating the different materials in the standard kit for increased speed and portability, as well as incorporating electronic elements to automate the process, visualize the data, and wirelessly communicate the results. Our device will be similar to a wide-body retractable pen, with an approximate size of a pregnancy test. In order to market the proposed health product as a medical device, a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) must be submitted the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) because although the technology is safe and well-known, the intended use and product classification are not substantially equivalent to FDA-approved devices using similar technologies. Additionally, sufficient testing to show that the device is both safe and effective must be done. The value proposition associated with the development of the proposed device are that its use can be expanded to be useful to anyone interested in testing food for a particular ingredient and it has the potential to collect significant amounts of data related to consumer food intake.</p>

                                <p class="justify">Biomechanical analysis of sit-stand desks versus the traditional sit desk using a Nintendo Wii balance board. It is generally accepted that a sedentary lifestyle can lead to numerous health issues, including breast and colon cancers, diabetes, and ischaemic heart disease. Indeed, physical inactivity is associated, independent of Body Mass Index, with a greatly elevated any-cause risk of mortality. Although prior studies have been mixed on associations between occupational sitting and health issues, recent studies have shown statistically significant associations between both occupational and leisure sitting with physical cardio-metabolic risk factors, and mental psychological distress. As such, there has been a recent push for further study of workspace sitting, especially in the use of, and the effects of sit-stand workstations. However, the majority of the studies have focused on statstical health outcomes, and acceptability and useability of sit-stand workstations. Lower-back angle of inclination is within safe limits, and consistent center of position with low shifting was observed. As such, this preliminary human factors study of standing desk ergonomics show no evidence of chronic risk factors associated with the use of standing workstations.</p>
